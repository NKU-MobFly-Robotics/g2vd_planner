# G2VD Planner

G2VD planner is an efficient motion planning approach with grid-based generalized Voronoi diagrams. It has been applied to mobile robot navigation in indoor and outdoor environments. 

The following video shows autonomous navigation in a large-scale campus with unknown static and dynamic obstacles.
