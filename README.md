# G<sup>2</sup>VD Planner

G<sup>2</sup>VD planner is an efficient motion planning approach with grid-based generalized Voronoi diagrams. It has been applied to mobile robot navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments. 

The following video shows autonomous navigation on a large-scale campus with unknown static and dynamic obstacles.
